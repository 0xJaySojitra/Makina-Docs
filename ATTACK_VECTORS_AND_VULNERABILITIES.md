# Smart Contract Attack Vectors and Vulnerability Assessment for Makina Protocol

## Overview

This document identifies potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities in smart contracts, with specific focus on the Makina protocol architecture. The analysis considers common attack patterns and evaluates their applicability to Makina's cross-chain vault system.

## Critical Contracts Requiring Close Examination

### 1. Machine Contract (`makina-core/src/machine/Machine.sol`)
**High Priority - Core Vault Logic**

**Critical Functions to Examine:**
- `deposit()` - ERC4626 deposit logic with cross-chain implications
- `redeem()` - Share redemption with AUM calculations
- `convertToShares()` / `convertToAssets()` - Price manipulation vectors
- `updateTotalAum()` - Central accounting mechanism
- Bridge transfer functions (`transferToSpokeCaliber`, `sendOutBridgeTransfer`)

**Potential Attack Vectors:**
- **Price Manipulation in Share Conversion**: Oracle dependency for `convertToShares()` could be manipulated
- **Reentrancy in Deposit/Redemption**: Complex cross-chain flows may introduce reentrancy windows
- **Integer Overflow in AUM Calculations**: Large position values could cause overflows

## Conclusion

The Makina protocol presents a complex attack surface due to its cross-chain nature, oracle dependencies, and sophisticated financial mechanisms. The highest risk areas are the core Machine and Caliber contracts, followed by bridge integrations and the security module. While many standard attack vectors are mitigated through established patterns like nonReentrant modifiers, the cross-chain and oracle-dependent nature of the protocol requires careful examination of business logic and external integrations.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Oracle manipulation and price feed security
- Cross-chain bridge protocol integrations
- Complex financial calculations in share conversions
- Access control in governance mechanisms
- External protocol dependencies in strategy execution

## Tested Coverage Map (from current makina-core tests)

- Reentrancy protections
  - Covered by tests:
    - `makina-core/test/integration/concrete/machine/deposit/deposit.t.sol` → reentrancy on `deposit()` rejected
    - `makina-core/test/integration/concrete/machine/redeem/redeem.t.sol` → reentrancy on `redeem()` rejected
    - `makina-core/test/integration/concrete/caliber/manage-position/managePosition.t.sol` → reentrancy around `managePosition()` rejected
    - `makina-core/test/integration/concrete/caliber/get-detailed-aum/getDetailedAum.t.sol` → reentrancy around `getDetailedAum()` rejected via induced callback
  - Gaps:
    - Cross-contract async paths outside reentrancy guard scope (expected, but keep in mind for integrations).

- Recovery mode / pausing
  - Covered by tests:
    - `machine/deposit/deposit.t.sol` and `machine/redeem/redeem.t.sol` → revert under `whileInRecoveryMode`
  - Gaps:
    - System-wide operations matrix under recovery mode (comprehensively) not fully enumerated in tests discovered.

- Access control (roles)
  - Covered by tests:
    - `machine/deposit/deposit.t.sol` → only depositor can call `deposit`
    - `machine/redeem/redeem.t.sol` → only redeemer can call `redeem`
    - `caliber/manage-position/managePosition.t.sol` → only mechanic; unauthorized callers revert
    - `bridge-controller/get-bridge-adapter/getBridgeAdapter.t.sol` → adapter must exist; role use shown elsewhere
    - `hub-core-factory/create-machine/createMachine.t.sol` → access-managed deployments must be called by `dao`
  - Gaps:
    - Full matrix of role/timelock for every setter not cross-asserted here (some exist under other directories).

- Slippage protections and limits
  - Covered by tests:
    - `machine/deposit/deposit.t.sol` → slippage check on `minSharesOut`, share limit and `maxMint`
    - `machine/redeem/redeem.t.sol` → slippage check on `minAssetsOut`, `maxWithdraw`
    - `machine/transfer-to-spoke-caliber/transferToSpokeCaliber.t.sol` → `MaxValueLossExceeded`, `MinOutputAmountExceedsInputAmount`
  - Gaps:
    - Aggregate slippage across chained operations (multi-hop) is by design handled via instruction proofs; not a single test.

- Oracle/price staleness and accounting freshness
  - Covered by tests:
    - `caliber/get-detailed-aum/getDetailedAum.t.sol` → position accounting staleness reverts; detailed AUM composition
  - Gaps:
    - Hub <-> spoke time skew edge cases beyond stale threshold boundary conditions.

- Instruction allow-list (Merkle proofs) and root updates
  - Covered by tests:
    - `caliber/manage-position/managePosition.t.sol` → invalid proofs (vault, posId, isDebt, groupId, affected tokens, commands, state, bitmap) revert
    - `caliber/manage-position/managePosition.t.sol` → timelocked `allowedInstrRoot` update behavior (pending vs effective)
  - Gaps:
    - Guardian set management breadth tested elsewhere; overall quorum/guardian failure scenarios not covered here.

- Bridge operations and state integrity
  - Covered by tests:
    - `machine/transfer-to-spoke-caliber/transferToSpokeCaliber.t.sol` → invalid chainId, adapter existence, out-transfer disabled, pending transfer, bridge state mismatch, max loss bps
    - Emission of scheduling events and idle token invariants asserted
  - Gaps:
    - End-to-end settlement across real bridge implementations is mocked; protocol-level checks are covered, not external bridge guarantees.

- AUM updates and conversions
  - Covered by tests:
    - `machine/deposit/deposit.t.sol` and `machine/redeem/redeem.t.sol` → `lastTotalAum` updates tracked
    - `caliber/get-detailed-aum/getDetailedAum.t.sol` → net AUM vs positions/base tokens; debt/non-debt handling
  - Gaps:
    - Extreme values/overflow fuzzing recommended (some fuzz dirs exist but not summarized here).

- Factory and initialization safety
  - Covered by tests:
    - `hub-core-factory/create-machine/createMachine.t.sol` → salts, emits, beacons, authority, roles; error paths (CREATE3 failures) covered
    - `machine/initialize/initialize.t.sol` → priceable accounting token enforced; share token ownership; with/without pre-deposit
  - Gaps:
    - Comprehensive input validation matrices for all factory paths beyond the above.

- Governance/timelock parameters
  - Covered by tests:
    - `caliber/manage-position/managePosition.t.sol` → timelock effect on `allowedInstrRoot`
    - `bridge-controller/*` → set/get toggles for out-transfer enabled and max loss bps (risk manager timelock)
  - Gaps:
    - Full suite of risk/governance setters across all contracts not collated here; verify per registry/factory unit tests.

Notes:
- Paths above are relative to `makina-core/test/` under `integration/concrete` or `unit/concrete`.
- External protocol/bridge/oracle compromises remain out-of-scope per your constraints; tests focus on protocol-side checks.
